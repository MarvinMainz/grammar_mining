This small doc further explains how to reduce duplicates.

In this case we are talking about duplicates in the wider sense, i.e. those which are not recognized by Zotero.
For those duplicates, which Zotero helps merging (cf. ("Creating Bibliographies")[Creating_bibliographies.md]), you do **not** need to follow this process or document your decisions!

This can include cases like the following:

case 1:

Federico Barbarosi wrote "Manual del vocabulario de la lengua pampa y del estilo familiar" and published it in 1879.
However, it was also published in the series "Memoria argentina" in the year 2000 as "Manual de la lengua pampa".
Without taking a look at the book it could be that in fact the newly published version does not contain the vocabulary and other information that the original encompassed; then one could say it is *not* a duplicate. *However*, for our purposes, this book is to be used as a grammar sketch and **we are  only interested in the grammatical description**. That means, that we can use the newly published version only, whether or not it contains the vocabulary etc.


case 2:

Raquel Guirardello first published a MA thesis called "Aspectos da morfossintaxe da liÂ­ngua Trumai (Isolada) e de seu sistema de marcaco de caso" in 1992.
There is also a book section by Guirardello in 1999, classified as grammar sketch. And if we look further, under grammar, we find a full reference grammar of over 400pages by Guirardello, also published in 1999.
What should we do?

My point of view is, that if there is a thesis and a published book version, **where the thesis is published less than 5 years before the book**, we may only use the book and delete the thesis (**except in case that the thesis is considerably longer than the book!**).
If the thesis is more than 5 years older than the book and/or there are new co-authors, we should rather keep both (our definition of MED and MRD will help us here).
A shorter version e.g. as an article or book section may be handy to get some key information very quickly, so I would keep it.

For this case, that means:
We keep all three references.

However, one could also decide to delete the thesis from our corpus, however, none of the others. The 5-year-mark is only a rule of thumb.

Make your own informed decisions; take a short look at the reference if necessary.

But most importantly, for all such cases: **document your decision** and the reason for it in the ods document for duplicates I am sending you. Also, the more difficult the decision, the more you should tend to preserve all the references. Make extensive comments for every fringe case, where you decided to delete a reference!
