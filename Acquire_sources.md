# Creating bibliographies

This is both a documentation of what we are doing and a more specific instruction on how we systematically secure access to the sources described in our reference and make them more easily operable for our general data acquisition process for linguistics descriptions.

0. What we did for preparation of this step: I performed step1 (defining the scope) and together we performed step2 (creating bibliographies) of our data acquisition process and documented our progress in a checklist.
So at this point, we have a comprehensive, tagged and sorted bibliography of all the languages within scope.

What we do in this step, may be subdivided into 3 phases:

- acquire sources
- store all sources in a neat and orderly manner
- link sources to their reference


Which we achieve as follows:

## Gramfinder

1. The main step will be to find and download sources from the restricted website gramfinder.
I have written a script for downloading from Gramfinder (at current [downloading_script_v2.2.4_flexible.py](downloading_script_v2.2.4_flexible.py)).

## Zotero

2. Zotero has an option called "find available PDFs" (you can use it by selecting several items and clicking right; more information on this can be found on the Zotero forum). This may retrieve freely accessible documents - and also documents available to our institutions, given we are in the intranet or use the institution's VPN. However, this only works for items with an identifier (DOI, or possibly ISBN).

## Other means

3. If neither the Zotero function nor Gramfinder yield a readable PDF, please look in our Uni library's catalogue and other places you know (e.g. [archive.org](archive.org) for older works).


4. Importantly, every document that is not directly downloaded via Zotero needs to be imported into Zotero and matched to its corresponding reference.
You can then connect every file to its reference in Zotero, simply by dragging the file onto the correct reference.

## ZotFile

5. Rename every file after download. The Zotero plugin ZotFile will rename and store all of our documents. Set the ZotFile preferences (under "Tools" in Zotero) to store a (renamed) copy in the dedicated Zotero storage folder. We use the standard template of "author(s)\_year_title" for renaming; excluding whitespace, setting everthing to lower case and truncating overly long titles.

Note: The documents from Gramfinder have a clear naming strategy ("1st Author last name DASH 2nd Author last name UNDERSCORE salient word(s) from the title YEAR" plus indication whether it has been OCRed); but since we can restore these at any time, we will also use our renaming pattern on them for the sake of consistency.

We will also need ZotFile for managing our annotations in the **data extraction** process.
